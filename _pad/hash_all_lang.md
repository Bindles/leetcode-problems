Manual Tally in JavaScript
Longhand Version
This is equivalent to the Ruby code where you use hash[char] ||= 0:


// Given a string s
let s = "example";

// Initialize an empty object
let hash = {};

// Iterate through each character in the string
for (let char of s) {
    if (!(char in hash)) {
        hash[char] = 0;
    }
    hash[char] += 1;
}

console.log(hash);
Using a More Concise Approach
In JavaScript, you don't have a built-in method like Ruby's Hash.new(0) or Python's defaultdict, but you can still achieve a concise version using the same logic:


// Given a string s
let s = "example";

// Initialize an empty object
let myhash = {};

// Iterate through each character in the string
for (let char of s) {
    myhash[char] = (myhash[char] || 0) + 1;
}

console.log(myhash);
In the longhand version, you manually check if the character is not already a key in the object and initialize it to 0 if it's not. Then, you increment the count.

In the concise version, myhash[char] = (myhash[char] || 0) + 1 is a shorthand for initializing the count to 0 if the key does not exist, then incrementing it.

Comparison to Ruby and Python Code
Ruby (longhand):


hash = {}
s.each_char do |char|
  if hash[char].nil?
    hash[char] = 0
  end
  hash[char] += 1
end
Python (longhand):


hash = {}
for char in s:
    if char not in hash:
        hash[char] = 0
    hash[char] += 1
JavaScript (longhand):


let s = "example";
let hash = {};
for (let char of s) {
    if (!(char in hash)) {
        hash[char] = 0;
    }
    hash[char] += 1;
}
Ruby (concise):


myhash = Hash.new(0)
s.each_char do |char|
  myhash[char] += 1
end
Python (concise):


from collections import defaultdict

myhash = defaultdict(int)
for char in s:
    myhash[char] += 1
JavaScript (concise):


let s = "example";
let myhash = {};
for (let char of s) {
    myhash[char] = (myhash[char] || 0) + 1;
}
All three languages achieve the same result, allowing you to tally character frequencies in a string.
